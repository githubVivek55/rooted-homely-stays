# Rooted Homely Stays — Next.js scaffold

This is a minimal Next.js site for a small rental-home business. It includes a simple homepage that describes the service and contact info.

Getting started (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd d:\dev\nextjs\rooted-homely-stays
npm install
npm run dev
```

After running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes

- This scaffold uses `next`, `react` and `react-dom` set to `latest` in `package.json`; pin versions if you need reproducible installs.
- If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server here, tell me and I will do that (it requires network access).
